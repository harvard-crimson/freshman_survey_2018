        <p>The Class of 2018 arrives in Cambridge from all walks of life and corners of the country, but a quarter of those surveyed have at least one thing in common: an immediate or extended family member that has walked these brick sidewalks and wood-paneled halls before. Of the students who have had a relative attend Harvard College, 16 percent are considered legacies, meaning they have at least one parent who attended the College and, according to the admissions office, could have gotten a leg up in the admissions process because of it. As a whole, The Crimson's survey of roughly 70 percent of incoming freshmen reveals a class that is in line with trends toward greater ethnic diversity, high combined family income, and shifting career ambitions.</p>

                <div id="gender" class="graph"></div>
                <p>While data from last year&rsquo;s survey showed that the Class of 2017 was evenly split between males and females, 53 percents of respondents said they are male. Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons &rsquo;67 said in March that the College had admitted more men than women for the Class of 2018.</p>

                <p>White students make up the largest portion of the Class of 2018—62 percent of respondents identified as such. Twenty-nine percent of respondents identified as Asian, including people of Indian descent. The data indicates that the ethnic composition of the Class of 2018 is largely congruent to that of the Class of 2017.</p>

                <p>Nearly 20 percent of those surveyed in the Class of 2018 intend to play varsity sports at Harvard. In addition to the 11 percent of respondents who said they were recruited athletes, 9 percent plan to walk on to a varsity team. Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships to recruited athletes or give out merit scholarships of any kind.</p>

                <p>Freshmen who reported higher family incomes were more likely to be a recruited athlete. While 11 percent of survey respondents said they are a recruited athlete, 16 percent of freshmen reporting a combined parental income above $500,000 said they are a recruited athlete. Only 1 percent of freshmen reporting a combined parental income below $40,000 said they are a recruited athlete.</p>

                <p>Similarly to data from last year’s survey, oldest children constitute a plurality of those in the Class of 2018. Forty-two percent of survey respondents reported that they are the eldest child in their family. Youngest children make up 29 percent of survey respondents, while only 15 percent reported they are an only child.</p>

                <p>Sixty-one percent of surveyed freshmen said they attended a public high school, with the overwhelming majority of them at a non-charter school.

                <p>Twenty-one percent of survey respondents from urban areas reported that they had at least one parent attend Harvard College, compared to 16 percent of the entire freshman class. Only 8 percent of rural residents indicated that either parent was a Harvard undergraduate.</p>

No surveyed freshman with a parental income of less than $40,000 said that his or her parent went to Harvard College, while 37 percent of those with a parental income of more than $500,000 said that at least one of their parents went to Harvard College.

Close to 16 percent reported that at least one of their parents was a Harvard Undergraduate, thus they are considered legacies by the College. Applications from members of this group “may receive an additional look” in the admissions process, according to the College.</p>
