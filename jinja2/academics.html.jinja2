        <p>Part III of The Crimson&#39;s survey of the Class of 2017 looks at incoming freshmen&#39;s academic and extracurricular lives&mdash;and how they prioritize the two. The survey of more than 1,300 members of the freshman class sheds light on what these students did in high school and what they plan to do in college. Some of them admitted to cheating, others said they have been concussed, and nearly all of them say they expect to make academics their top priority at Harvard. This and other data on their experiences and plans in the classroom, in clubs, and on the playing field reveals a group defined by both their similarities and their differences.</p>

                <p>Ten percent of respondents admitted to cheating on an exam during high school, the same percent as those who responded to last year’s survey. By comparison, 6 percent of last year’s graduating seniors who responded to The Crimson’s senior survey admitted to cheating on a paper or exam in college.</p>

                <p>Twenty-two percent of respondents admitted to cheating on a problem set or homework assignment in high school, a significant decrease from last year, when 42 percent of surveyed incoming freshmen reported doing so. Fifteen percent of of last year’s graduating seniors who responded to The Crimson’s senior survey admitted to cheating on a problem set or homework assignment during their time in college.</p>

                <p>Eleven percent of respondents from public schools reported cheating on an exam and on a paper or take-home assignment, compared to 7.6 percent and 9 percent of private school students, respectively. The percentage of this year’s respondents from public school who admitted cheating on a paper or take-home assignment declined by about 9 percentage points from last year.</p>
