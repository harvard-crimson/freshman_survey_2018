        <p>Part IV of The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2018 focuses on the beliefs and lifestyles of the incoming freshmen. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they were still virgins. Even fewer have tried marijuana or smoked a cigarette. When it comes to politics, the Class of 2018 appears to be decidedly liberal, with a majority favorably rating President Barack Obama and same-sex marriage. While the survey’s respondents—who account for more than 70 percent of the incoming class—are less alike when it comes to religion, most seem to be united in their attachment to Facebook.</p>

                <p>The largest religious group, at 19 percent of the surveyed freshman class, identified as Catholic. The next most popular religions, in descending order, were Protestantism, Judaism, and Islam. However, a combined 36 percent of freshmen characterized themselves as atheist or agnostic, several points above the national average.</p>

                <p>Although 54 percent of surveyed freshmen said they identify with a major religion, only 41 percent said they consider themselves in any way religious. Fewer still—23 percent of respondents—characterized themselves as either religious or very religious. By contrast, 61 percent of Harvard's newest students said they are either not very religious or not religious at all.</p>

                <p>Of students surveyed from outside the United States, 43 percent identified themselves as atheist or agnostic.</p>
                <p>In the Northeast, which slightly over two-fifths of respondents call home, 21 percent said they are Catholic, 16 percent said they are Protestant, and 14 percent—the largest proportion of any region—identified as Jewish. Thirty-four percent of surveyed Northeasterners said they consider themselves atheist or agnostic.</p>

                <div id="phone-type" class="graph"></div>
                <p>Seventy-three percent of respondents said they own an iPhone. 20 percent said they have an Android phone, and 4 percent a non-smart phone. Only three respondents reported that they do not own a cell phone.</p>

                <h2>Mac Ownership by Parents&#39; Income</h2>
                <div id="income-mac" class="graph"></div>
                <p>All income brackets were more likely to own a Mac than a PC, though higher brackets were substantially more likely to own a Mac than lower ones. Ninety-one percent of respondents whose parents combine to earn more than $500,000 a year own a Mac.</p>

                <h2>iPhone Ownership by Parents&#39; Income</h2>
                <div id="income-iphone" class="graph"></div>
                <p>In each and every income bracket, the iPhone is king. Overall, 73 percent of respondents said they own an iPhone, including nearly 91 percent of students whose parents make more than $500,000. However, as family income decreases, so does iPhone ownership; just 54 percent of respondents in the lowest income bracket—a combined parental income below $40,000—reported owning an iPhone.</p>

                <h2>Facebook Usage</h2>
                <div id="facebook" class="graph"></div>
                <p>An overwhelming majority—98 percent—of surveyed freshmen said they have a Facebook account. Among these Facebook users, only 18 percent said they spend more than an hour a day on the social media site.</p>

            <li id="twitter-tab">
                <h2>Twitter Usage</h2>
                <div id="twitter" class="graph"></div>
                <p>Though nearly all respondents reported having a Facebook account, a little less than half of surveyed freshmen said they have an account with the social media site&rsquo;s competitor, Twitter. Those who reported having Twitter accounts said they spend on average much less time on Twitter than on Facebook, with most spending fewer than 15 minutes each day.</p>
